## Introduction
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. 

## Business Problem
Danny aims to utilize data for prescriptive analysis to steer future decisions for Foodie_Fi. This analysis delves into scenarios such as how many customers continue after their trial run, how many discontinue after the trial, and whether customers opt to downgrade their plans.
